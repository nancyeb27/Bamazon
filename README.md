Bamazon - Your on line shopping experience!

This app is an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL skills. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

The app will prompt users with two messages.

The first will ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app should log advise the customer that there is an Insufficient quantity!, and to please visit us again later.

However, if the store does have enough of the product, the order will be fulfilled, which will update the store inventory database.

Once the update goes through, the customer will be shown the total cost of their purchase.

The customer will then be asked if they would like to make another purchase, if yes,the shopping experience will begin again. 

If the response is NO, the customer will thanked and asked to come back soon.
